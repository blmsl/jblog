    "content": "<p>Itâ€™s very rare for me to look at one of my completed artworks and be impressed by it. I usually spend most of my time noticing all the errors I made during drawing or editing, or trying not to look at the bits Iâ€™m least proud of.</p>\n<p>This one, however, is different.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/art/view/484\"><img class=\"posted\" src=\"http://jbrowne.me.uk/art/images/hat_thief.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>I know I say this with every artwork I post about in this journal, but this is by far my most impressive artwork to dateâ€”and itâ€™s one of a very small handful of images I can actually step back to look at and enjoy.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™m still somewhat impressed I drew it, especially after taking quite an extended Christmas break. Usually if I take a break, the quality of the pictures I draw immediately afterwards are variable and it takes me a while to get back up to speed. This picture appears to have broken that trend somewhat.</p>\n<p>I actually donâ€™t have much to say about this picture in comparison to the others Iâ€™ve drawn ðŸ˜Š . Iâ€™d recently finished playing PokÃ©mon Sun and these two characters were my favourite in the game, driving the storyline and a fair few emotional momentsâ€”especially closer to the end. I decided to pay tribute to both of them without giving away too many clues to the storyline and after a while the picture started to take this form.</p>\n<p>Only downside to this picture is that Iâ€™ve now set the bar really high for all future works to be compared to. Iâ€™m going to have to try really hard to get the next image I draw to lookâ€”and feelâ€”anywhere near as good!</p>",
